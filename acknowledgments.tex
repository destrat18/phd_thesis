% Supervisors
I was privileged to have Prof. Goharshady as my PhD supervisor. His insights and guidance were instrumental in my growth as a researcher. He consistently supported me in navigating career choices, grant applications, teaching opportunities, and interviews. I have always valued our long discussions about discussing with me the right and wrong paths, whether in research, career, or life itself.
Upon graduation, I recognize that many questions remain unresolved. Still, his mentorship has equipped me with the confidence to seek my own answers moving forward.

I also extend my appreciation to my co-supervisor, Prof. Shen, for his consistent support during my time at HKUST. I am thankful for the mentorship of Prof. S. Akshay, Prof. Supratik Chakraborty, and Prof. Djordje Zikelic, whose valuable insights guided my research direction and career development.

% Colleagues
During my PhD, I had the privilege of working alongside exceptionally talented collaborators. Sergei Novozhilov helped me navigate many complex research problems. Our stormy meetings with Harshit Motwani pushed me beyond my academic comfort zone. With Togzhan Barakbayeva, I built working solutions from our research ideas. The conversations and work we shared shaped many chapters of this thesis.

I am also grateful for the support and collaboration of my ALPACAS colleagues: Jonas Ballweg, Xuran Cai, Zhuo Cai, Dr. Giovanna Kobus Conrado, Pavel Hudec, Dr. S. Hitarth, Kerim Kochekov, Chun Kit Lam, Pingjiang Li, Zhaorun Lin, Tian Shu, and Ahmed Zaher.

% Family
I owe a profound debt of gratitude to my parents, Marzieh Javameh and Saeid Farokhnia, for their unwavering support throughout my PhD. My brother Sepher also deserves equal recognition\footnote{Though I must note that fewer hours spent debating Middle-earth would have likely yielded additional papers.}.

% Sanaz
I must also express my deepest appreciation to my fianc\'ee, Sanaz Safaei. This doctorate would not have been possible without her kind support and encouragement. It is only fitting that our next chapter begins just as this PhD comes to a close.

% Teachers
I owe recognition to my teachers over the years, whose guidance has brought me to this point. Mahdi Kazemi and Hossein Boomari introduced me to the world of computer science. Mohammadreza Shabanali's writings have served as my compass for personal and intellectual growth. The advice of Reza Sajjadi and Behnam Shakibafar helped me in the early stages of my career.

Finally, I am grateful to HKUST and the Ethereum Foundation, who financially supported my PhD, and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, which awarded me a research fellowship.
