% Supervisors
I was privileged to have Amir Goharshady as my PhD supervisor. His insights and guidance were instrumental in my growth as a researcher. He consistently supported me in navigating career choices, grant applications, teaching opportunities, and interviews. Our long discussions about the right and wrong paths, whether in research, career, or life itself, have always been invaluable to me.


I am grateful to my co-supervisor, Jiasi Shen, for her consistent support throughout my time at HKUST. Thanks are also due to S. Akshay and Supratik Chakraborty for hosting my visit to IIT Bombay and for sharing valuable perspective on both research and career development.
I greatly value the mentorship of \DJ or\dj e $\mathbf{\check{\text{Z}}}$ikeli\'{c}, which supported my professional development.
Finally, I appreciate Dimitris Papadopoulos and Junxian He for agreeing to chair my thesis defense sessions.

% COllaborators
During my PhD, I had the privilege of working alongside exceptionally talented collaborators. Sergei Novozhilov helped me navigate many complex research problems. Our stormy meetings with Harshit Motwani pushed me beyond my academic comfort zone. With Togzhan Barakbayeva, I built working solutions from our research ideas. We spent countless hours tackling new challenges, meeting tight deadlines, sharing working lunches, and making room for bold ideas. The conversations and work we shared influenced many chapters of this thesis.

% Alpacas
I am also proud to be part of the ALPACAS group and appreciate the support from my colleagues: Jonas Ballweg, Xuran Cai, Zhuo Cai, Giovanna Kobus Conrado, Pavel Hudec, S. Hitarth, Kerim Kochekov, Chun Kit Lam, Pingjiang Li, Richard Magambo, Zhaorun Lin, Tian Shu, and Ahmed Zaher.

% Family
I owe a profound debt of gratitude to my parents, Marzieh Javameh and Saeid Farokhnia, for their unwavering support throughout my life. My brother Sepher also deserves recognition for his encouragement and our many discussions\footnote{Though I must note that fewer hours spent debating Middle-earth could have helped me write a couple more papers!}.
% New Family
I must also express my deepest appreciation to my fianc\'ee, Sanaz Safaei. This doctorate would not have been possible without her kind support and encouragement. It is only fitting that our next chapter begins as this one closes.

% Teachers
I am grateful to my teachers over the years, whose guidance has brought me to this point. Mahdi Kazemi and Hossein Boomari introduced me to the world of computer science. I have repeatedly returned to Mohammadreza Shabanali’s writings for direction in personal growth and in how I think and learn. In the early stages of my career, I benefited greatly from the advice of Behnam Shakibafar and Reza Sajjadi.

Finally, I am grateful to HKUST and the Ethereum Foundation, which financially supported my PhD, and to the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, which awarded me a research fellowship.
