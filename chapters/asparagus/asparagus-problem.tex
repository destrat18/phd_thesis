\section{Gas Upper Bound as Synthesis Problem}\label{sec:mining-ethereum-algorithm} 

\para{Our Focus} In this chapter, we focus on the problem of automated synthesis of parametric bounds on the gas usage of a smart contract. This problem is well-studied in the literature. There are two main motivations for automated bound synthesis: (i)~ensuring that a contract can safely call libraries and functions in other contracts, and (ii)~avoiding out-of-gas vulnerabilities, where wrong estimations of the gas behavior of a smart contract can lead to catastrophic real-world consequences. In the simplest case, if a user mistakenly underestimates the amount of gas that is needed for the execution of their desired function call and chooses a maximum gas value that is too small, then they would lose their entire deposit in the process above. This happens even if the estimate was just one unit short of the required gas. While this is irritating, out-of-gas errors can lead to much more severe losses, as further described below. Moreover, the decision on the allocated gas is not always taken by the final user, but often by the programmer of a smart contract.
