\section{Problem of Ethereum Block Production}\label{sec:mining-ethereum-problem} 

Our goal in this section is to develop an optimization approach to increase the transaction-fee (gas) revenues of Ethereum miners. Although we focus on Ethereum, our techniques are general in nature and can be applied to other programmable blockchains as well. There are two reasons for the emphasis on Ethereum: First, Ethereum is currently the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind only Bitcoin. At the time of writing, it has a total value of around 250 billion USD~\cite{coinmarketcap}. 
It is also by far the largest programmable cryptocurrency, with support for arbitrary smart contracts written in a Turing-complete language~\cite{wood2014ethereum}. Second, Ethereum has an account-based execution model which is significantly different than the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model of Bitcoin. Thus, there is a research gap as the techniques developed for Bitcoin and other UTXO miners, such as Section~\ref{sec:mining-cardano-problem}, are not applicable in our context.
